<h2> Raptors'Bench Mob' has playoff foes on its hit list</h2>
<p>After being swept away by LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in the second round of the 2017 playoffs, many called for a rebuild and coaching change but the organization stayed the course.

Toronto re-signed Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka to keep its "big three" with DeMar DeRozan intact, while head coach Dwane Casey and his staff were kept on and went to work transforming the team's style of play to better fit the modern NBA game. </p>

<h3> Christine Sinclair: Hosting World Cup would be huge for Canada</h3>
<p> The iconic Canadian forward is just as passionate about playing for her country now, at age 34, Christine Sinclair made her national team debut as a 16-year-old.

This past week’s friendly against France in Rennes, a 1-0 loss, was Sinclair’s 267th career cap. She’ll no doubt add to that record number of appearances in the buildup to next summer’s FIFA Women’s World Cup to be held in France.

Sportsnet recently chatted with Sinclair about the departure of John Herdman, new Canadian coach Kenneth Heiner-Møller, the future of the women’s team, and Canada’s bid to co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup with the United States and Mexico. </p>

<h4> Conor McGregor’s UFC future on the line </h4>
<p> McGregor was arraigned Friday on charges of felony criminal mischief charges and misdemeanour assault, menacing and reckless endangerment charges following a backstage melee he sparked at a UFC event in New York City. 

McGregor was released on $50,000 bond — pocket change for a fighter who was guaranteed $30 million last year in his ballyhooed boxing match against Floyd Mayweather Jr. McGregor is due back in court June 14.</p>
